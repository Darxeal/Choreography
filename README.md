# "Awakening" Choreography

This is the source code used to make the third entry in [Rocket Sledge's Rocket League Airshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x53kCucaLlI).

The main code used in the video is in ``ChoreographyHive/choreography/choreos/connected.py`` and ``ChoreographyHive/choreography/choreos/dragons.py``
There's also a few experiments and choreographies that weren't used in the final video.

For setup, usage instructions and the original code we forked from, check out https://github.com/tarehart/RLBotChoreography

This project also uses a custom compiled version of https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities
